# Python Math Exercises

A collection of short, daily Python notebooks designed to strengthen both **math intuition** and **coding fluency**.  
Each notebook tackles a small but meaningful problem, progressing from scratch implementations toward more Pythonic and library-based solutions.  

The goal: **move from guided learning → real-world problem solving in Jupyter**, while practicing version control with Git/GitHub.

## ✏️ Exercises

### Day 1 – Vectors
- Implemented vector addition and dot products from scratch.  
- Compared with NumPy’s built-in vector operations.  

### Day 2 – Matrices
- Built matrix multiplication manually with loops.  
- Verified results using NumPy’s `dot` function.  
- Learned about timing differences between manual vs. optimized NumPy operations.  

### Day 3 – Probabilities (Dice Simulation)
- Simulated dice rolls with Python’s `random` module.  
- Calculated frequencies of sums (2–12) and compared with theoretical probabilities.  
- Optional visualization using `matplotlib` for simulated vs. theoretical distributions.
