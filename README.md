# Python Math Exercises

A collection of short, daily Python notebooks designed to strengthen both **math intuition** and **coding fluency**.  
Each notebook tackles a small but meaningful problem, progressing from scratch implementations toward more Pythonic and library-based solutions.

The goal: **move from guided learning → real-world problem solving in Jupyter**, while practicing version control with Git/GitHub.

## ✏️ Exercises

### Day 1 – Vectors
- Implemented vector addition and dot products from scratch.
- Compared with NumPy’s built-in vector operations.

### Day 2 – Matrices
- Built matrix multiplication manually with loops.
- Verified results using NumPy’s `dot` function.
- Timed manual vs. NumPy operations.

### Day 3 – Probabilities (Dice Simulation)
- Simulated dice rolls with Python’s `random` module.
- Calculated frequencies of sums (2–12) and compared with theoretical probabilities.
- Optional visualization using `matplotlib` for simulated vs. theoretical distributions.

## 🔧 Setup & Usage

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/python-math-exercises.git
   cd python-math-exercises
   ```

2. Install dependencies (most are standard in Jupyter):
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

4. Open any notebook and run the cells.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Practice **Python fundamentals** (loops, lists, dicts, functions).
- Build intuition for **linear algebra & probability** through code.
- Get comfortable with **NumPy** and **matplotlib**.
- Develop **Git + GitHub workflow habits** (add → commit → push).
