# Python Math Exercises

A collection of short, daily Python notebooks designed to strengthen both **math intuition** and **coding fluency**.  
Each notebook tackles a small but meaningful problem, progressing from scratch implementations toward more Pythonic and library-based solutions.  

The goal: **move from guided learning → real-world problem solving in Jupyter**, while practicing version control with Git/GitHub.

## ✏️ Exercises

### Day 1 – Vectors
- Implemented vector addition and dot products from scratch.  
- Compared with NumPy’s built-in vector operations.  

### Day 2 – Matrices
- Built matrix multiplication manually with loops.  
- Verified results using NumPy’s `dot` function.  
- Learned about timing differences between manual vs. optimized NumPy operations.  

### Day 3 – Probabilities (Dice Simulation)
- Simulated dice rolls with Python’s `random` module.  
- Calculated frequencies of sums (2–12) and compared with theoretical probabilities.  
- Optional visualization using `matplotlib` for simulated vs. theoretical distributions.

## 🔧 Setup & Usage

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cleburn/python-math-exercises.git
   cd python-math-exercises

2.	Install dependencies (most are standard in Jupyter):
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib

3.	Launch Jupyter:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab

4.	Open any notebook and run the cells.

🎯 Learning Goals
	•	Practice Python fundamentals (loops, lists, dicts, functions).
	•	Build intuition for linear algebra & probability through code.
	•	Get comfortable with NumPy and matplotlib.
	•	Develop Git + GitHub workflow habits (add → commit → push).
