# Python Math Exercises

A collection of short, daily Python notebooks designed to strengthen both **math intuition** and **coding fluency**.  
Each notebook tackles a small but meaningful problem, progressing from scratch implementations toward more Pythonic and library-based solutions.

The goal: **move from guided learning → real-world problem solving in Jupyter**, while practicing version control with Git/GitHub.

## Exercises ✏️

### Week 1 Wrap-Up — Python in Practice + Math Warmup
This week established strong Python fundamentals through hands-on math exercises in Jupyter.  
Each day built confidence in implementing core concepts from scratch (vectors, matrices, probabilities) and then validating them with NumPy.  
By the end of the week, I pushed my first GitHub repo with 4 completed notebooks, developed a daily terminal → Jupyter → GitHub workflow, and saw firsthand how NumPy streamlines performance and syntax.  
Ready to move into Week 2: NumPy & Pandas Foundations.

### Day 1 – Vectors
- Implemented vector addition and dot products from scratch.  
- Compared with NumPy’s built-in vector operations.  

### Day 2 – Matrices
- Built matrix multiplication manually with loops.  
- Verified results using NumPy’s `dot` function.  
- Timed manual vs. NumPy operations.  

### Day 3 – Probabilities (Dice Simulation)
- Simulated dice rolls with Python’s `random` module.  
- Calculated frequencies of sums (2–12) and compared with theoretical probabilities.  
- Optional visualization using `matplotlib` for simulated vs. theoretical distributions.  

### Day 4 – From Scratch → NumPy
- Rebuilt a previous math exercise (vector ops, matrix multiplication, or dice simulation) in pure Python.  
- Refactored the same task using NumPy arrays and vectorized operations.  
- Compared performance of pure Python vs. NumPy with timing tests on small and large matrices.  
- Reflected on how NumPy simplifies syntax and speeds up computation.

## Setup & Usage 🔧
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cleburn/python-math-exercises.git
   cd python-math-exercises
   ```

2. Install dependencies (most are standard in Jupyter):
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

4. Open any notebook and run the cells.

## Learning Goals 🎯
- Practice **Python fundamentals** (loops, lists, dicts, functions).  
- Build intuition for **linear algebra & probability** through code.  
- Get comfortable with **NumPy** and **matplotlib**.  
- Develop **Git + GitHub workflow habits** (add → commit → push).
